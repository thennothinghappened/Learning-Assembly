# Learning-Assembly
Pretty self-explanatory title, this is a repo where I'm learning some x86 assembly!

This is something I've wanted to get into properly for a while but didn't really
find the time or motivation until now.

The makefile provided is really just for my own benefit - unless you're also on
an M2 Mac with `nasm`, `gcc` and Rosetta 2, it likely won't be of much use.

That's the other thing - and hopefully it doesn't cause any issues (probably won't,
it's really stable!), I'm using Rosetta for this since learning ARM assembly (and its variants)
is a whole other deal I'm not ready to get into right now, where x86 is more approachable
with online discussion around learning it.
